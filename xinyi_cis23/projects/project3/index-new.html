            <h3 id="union-head">What Is A Union?</h3>

            <p id="union-paragraph">A union is an organized group of workers who act collectively to build power and improve their working conditions. Through a union, workers can bargain collectively for improvements to wages, benefits, and other terms of employment, ultimately securing those improvements in a union contract.</p>

            <h3 id="student-why-head">Why are College Students Unionising?</h3>

            <p id="student-why-paragraph">College campuses have increasingly outsourced their labour to students themselves, as they staff essential parts of college and play a part in creating the 'college experience', such as library staff, teaching courses, building community, amongst others. With ever-increasing tuition costs, students are looking to demand better and fairer terms of employment.
                Historically, colleges have also been resistant to student employees unionising. <br>
                According to this <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/learnandearn/#resources"> 2018 report,</a>70% of college students work. ‘But a true portrait of today’s “working learners” depicts a far more varied population that increasingly includes students who work full time while going to school, as well as those who work part-time, but are logging more than 15 hours each week’
            </p>

            <h4 id="quote1">“About 14 million students are working learners, defined as individuals both active in the labor market and formally enrolled at postsecondary institutions. “</h4>

                ‘The divide between who needs to work and who works to gain experience reminds students that college is not the grand education-centered equalizer, but is also yet another site of labor. ‘
                <br>
                “Students are realizing just how much institutions rely on our labor to function—not just tuition or financial aid, but our labor.”

         <h3 id="want-head">What do Student Workers Want?</h3>

         <p id="student-union-demands">
            <ul>
                <li>Better Working Conditions, such as more control over shift timings and responsive management</li>
                <li>Fair and Just Compensation. Student positions, such as resident assistants, require enormous amounts of effort and long shifts. Paying students a fair wage would reduce the need to get a second job to make ends meet and reduce burnout. </li>
                <li>Job Security. Some positions require an annual application process, despite student employees performing well in the position. </li>
                <li>Benefits. Like any other job, benefits such as Seniority Pay, Health Insurance, and more are amongst some of the things that can incentivise better job performance and employee satisfaction.</li>
