             Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>

            <div id="act"> that in the beginning was the <em> Act,</em></div> </h1>

                A state of real existence rather than possibility. <br>
                <em> And poets love possibility! </em> <br>
                 They love to wonder and explore. <br>
                 <em> Hard lot! 
                 But the poem, no matter how full of possibility,
                  has to exist!</em> 
                  To conduct oneself, to behave. 
                  How a poem acts marks its individual character.
                  A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. 
                  to pretend, feign, impersonate. 
                  That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre.
                   As the poet Ralph angel puts it,

                   “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.”</div>
                   <em> the weird theatrical shit</em> <br>
                   is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; <br> </div>
                  <div id="end"><em>in other words, self-consciousness is theatre. </em> </div>
