      <div class="myDIV">I didn't know what facebook was until I started elementary school. I remember most of my friends bragging about being on it, despite the age requirement being 13</div>
    <div class="hide">we were 7!</div>
    <div class="myDIV">I proceeded to go home and ask my parents for permission </div>
    <div class="hide">to which they easily agreed to?</div>
    <div class="myDIV">to create a facebook account. </div>

        <div class="myDIV">is the only game I remember playing on facebook </div>
        <div class="hide">I probably played more games, I just don't remember the other ones</div>
        <div class="myDIV">and I found it pretty fun. <br> I haven't played it since I deleted my facebook account when I was 13 </div>
        <div class="hide">how ironic</div>


        <h3>side note: here's an interesting article I found about Pet Society, which pretty accurately describes how the game was played. <a href="https://medium.com/game-design-fundamentals/a-critical-play-of-pet-society-8aa6add6b606">article here!</a></h3>
