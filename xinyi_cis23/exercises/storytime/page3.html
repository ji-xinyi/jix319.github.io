    <h1>Fanmade Wikis</h1>
    <div class="myDIV">I was very into Harry Potter growing up.</div>
    <div class="hide">Naturally, I felt the need to know <em>everything</em>
        <br>
        <em>I mean everything</em>
         <br>
         about the series and characters.</div>

    <div class="myDIV">I knew what wikipedia was
        <br> and thought that fan-made wikis were essentially Wikipedia-endorsed sites</div>
    <div class="hide">and were therefore the <em>most correct and accurate</em>  places to learn more about my favourite things.</div>

    <p>on that note, here's a link to one of the first articles I read lol</p>
