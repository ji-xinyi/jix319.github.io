    <h1>Online Games!</h1>

    <div class="myDIV">I distinctly remember playing a few online games on random websites, one of which is linked here.</div>
    <div class="hide">(it is also the <em>only</em> one of such websites I can recall at all)</div>
    <div class="myDIV">I mostly played games that included cake factory assembly lines, and makeovers. </div>
    <div class="hide">I also used one of the games I played as an example of a hobby for an elementary school show & tell once.
        <br> That was an interesting life choice 12 years ago.</div>
