          <a href="https://canalstreet.market/">Canal St Market</a>
          <p>Canal St Market is a community space that has retail and food vendors, located in Manhattan's Chinatown. I chose this website as I thought that the tab structure and interactive elements were interesting, and I was also curious as to how the integrated the few elements that were traditional chinese characters.</p>
          <p>The website seems to use <em>div tags</em> throughout the page to contain its information and classifications using extremely specific selectors (both class and id) to indicate specific functions and effects intended on the page.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One thing I thought was interesting was how the tabs on the right (with the classifications <em>
            div class: transiiton-cover__tab js-cover-tab open id:1</em>) did not lead to a new page being opened, but I was able to seamlessly navigate back to the original positioning by simply clicking on the white area demarcating the home tab.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Another thing I found interesting was that when I toggled the screen to that of a mobile device, the tabs on the right disappeared. Some of the content that was on these tabs simply were added under the image in the home screen.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Upon more exploration, the website seems to be a single-page website, with only one page grounding all its content. This somewhat explains the specificity of selectors to me, but also makes me wonder why they opted for such a format instead of a multi-page navigational system. In addition, most of the elements had inline styles and javascript on the bottom of the page, which I thought was a <em>choice</em>, given what we were taught in studio (both this semester and the last) about linking external style sheets rather than doing CSS inline. </p>

        <li>
          <!-- TODO: Ask some questions! -->
          Why was there inline style and JS in the document? How or why might someone choose to do it this way rather than linking them separately?

          Why was there some lines of code commented out on the website rather than being deleted from the page?
